# FERFI-Facial Expression Recognition for Investigations 
# Introduction
in criminal related investigations, an investigator goal is to collect facts about an issue. Some of the events are collected from witnesses or suspects. In such stressful investigations many people tend to lie or hide the truth. This situation hinders the investigator from understanding the situation to make a decision. If an investigator finds a person under investigation is deceiving the police, this will encourage them to perform more investigation and analysis. If the accused is innocent or guilty, in this project the system can determine the destination and then show the result of the accused's feelings.
# Methodology
Deep learning(DL), machine learning(ML) and the FER-2013 dataset were used to build a neural network model, face-api JavaScript module was used to detect face in live video, HTML and CSS were used to design and build the website, PHP was used to design the MySQL database in which the investigator and defendant's data were stored. JavaScript was used to connect the neural network model with the website. Server life was also used to access the camera and record a live video.
